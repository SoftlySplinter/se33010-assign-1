SE33010 Assignment One
======================

This is the first of two SE33010 practical assignments. It will count for 10% of the total marks for the course. You should spend no more than eight hours of effort on this assignment.

**Deadline:** You must submit your assignment via SafeAssign on Blackboard before the deadline of **4:00pm on Thursday, 14th March**. You may submit your assignment via SafeAssign at any time up to the deadline.

For information about submitting an assignment via SafeAssign see: http://nexus.aber.ac.uk/xwiki/bin/download/Main/safeassign/SafeAssignguidestudent2012new.pdf

**N.B. Please ensure that you click the Submit button after you have attached your assignment to Blackboard.** If you do not click the Submit button the upload process will not be completed and your assignment will be lost.

Notes:

1.  If you cannot submit the assignment via SafeAssign, you must make alternative arrangements with me (or, exceptionally, with another member of staff) **before** the deadline.
2. If you submit work other than via SafeAssign, you must ensure that the work is dated and a receipt obtained.
3. Work which is submitted after the deadline, without prior permission (which is rarely given), will receive no marks. If you do hand in your work after the deadline, please also submit a “Late Assignment” form explaining why the work was handed in late.
4. If you feel that you have a very good reason for submitting your work late, you must seek the permission of the year co-ordinator (Neil Taylor <nst@aber.ac.uk>) before the deadline for submitting the work. In almost all cases you will be told to submit the work, in an incomplete state, by the deadline, and complete a Special Circumstances Form explaining the circumstances that made it impossible for you to complete the work, which must be accompanied by supporting evidence.

The web page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal methods lists a number of “Formal methods and notations” (including VDM and its derivatives). Choose one (but **not** VDM, VDM-SL, VDM++ or RAISE) and write *at most one page* comparing and contrasting the notation that you have chosen with VDM. For example, you could compare and contrast the syntax, the datatypes, the underlying logic, and possibly other aspects of the method. A couple of small examples would be helpful. 

Include a short paragraph describing the application area of the notation that you have chosen (an example application is sufficient).

Submit *no more* than the equivalent of one side of A4.

This assignment will be assessed using the “Assessment Criteria for Essays”.

See the Student Handbook, Appendix AC, via the URL: http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/Handbook/AppendixAC.pdf

**N.B.** SafeAssign accepts files in `.doc`, `.docx`, `.rtf`, `.odt`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.html` formats.

Marks will be deducted if you submit more than one side of A4.

To avoid problems with Word reformatting your document and changing the pagination, I suggest that you submit your assignment in PDF.

Deadline: You must submit your assignment via SafeAssign on Blackboard before the deadline of 4:00pm on Thursday, 14th March. You may submit your assignment via SafeAssign at any time up to the deadline.

**N.B.** Please ensure that you click the Submit button after you have attached your assignment to Blackboard. If you do not click the Submit button the upload process will not be completed and your assignment will be lost.
